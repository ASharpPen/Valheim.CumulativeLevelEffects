# Valheim.CumulativeLevelEffects

Lets LevelEffects enable gameobjects pr star.

Intended to help modders create creatures which can increasingly gain new features.

Eg., A skeleton that gets more and more armor pieces.

By default Valheims LevelEffects will only active the LevelSetup matching highest star level. This mod simply enables all the gameobjects in previous LevelSetup's.
